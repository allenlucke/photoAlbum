3. You will find two jar files in the libs folder, photoAlbum-1.0.jar is the file we are looking for.
4. It is recommended that you copy the executable jar to a directory outside of the project structure for execution.

## Executing in Terminal
1. Open up a bash shell and navigate to the folder containing the jar.
2. Run the program via command line. Utilizing the -a command line option to set which album to print.
3. For albumId #3 it would be the following: 'java -jar photoAlbum-1.0.jar -a 3'
